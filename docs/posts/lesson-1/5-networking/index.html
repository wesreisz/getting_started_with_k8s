<h1>Lesson 5: Networking</h1>

<div class="content ">
  <p>Kubernetes was built to run distributed systems over a cluster of machines. The very nature of distributed systems makes networking a central and necessary component of Kubernetes deployment, and understanding the Kubernetes networking model will allow you to correctly run, monitor and troubleshoot your applications running on Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<ol>
<li>Get introduced to the k8s networking model.</li>
<li>Get a glimpse at fundamental network behaviors the Kubernetes network model defines.</li>
<li>How DNS works within Kubernetes.</li>
<li>Discuss how K8s handles NAT outbound requests</li>
</ol>
<p>Every Pod gets its own IP address. This means you do not need to explicitly create links between Pods and you almost never need to deal with mapping container ports to host ports. This creates a clean, backwards-compatible model where Pods can be treated much like VMs or physical hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration.</p>
<p>Kubernetes imposes the following fundamental requirements on any networking implementation (barring any intentional network segmentation policies):</p>
<ul>
<li>pods on a node can communicate with all pods on all nodes without NAT
agents on a node (e.g. system daemons, kubelet) can communicate with all pods on that node
Note: For those platforms that support Pods running in the host network (e.g. Linux):</li>
<li>pods in the host network of a node can communicate with all pods on all nodes without NAT
This model is not only less complex overall, but it is principally compatible with the desire for Kubernetes to enable low-friction porting of apps from VMs to containers. If your job previously ran in a VM, your VM had an IP and could talk to other VMs in your project. This is the same basic model.</li>
<li>Kubernetes IP addresses exist at the Pod scope - containers within a Pod share their network namespaces - including their IP address. This means that containers within a Pod can all reach each other&rsquo;s ports on localhost. This also means that containers within a Pod must coordinate port usage, but this is no different from processes in a VM. This is called the &ldquo;IP-per-pod&rdquo; model.</li>
<li>Each node has an IP address assigned from the cluster&rsquo;s network (or VPC in the case of aws). This node IP provides connectivity from control components like kube-proxy and the kubelet to the Kubernetes API server. This IP is the node&rsquo;s connection to the rest of the cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pod networking</strong></p>
<p>Containers in different Pods have distinct IP addresses and can not communicate by IPC without special configuration. Containers that want to interact with a container running in a different Pod can use IP networking to communicate.</p>
<p>Containers within the Pod see the system hostname as being the same as the configured name for the Pod</p>
<p>Kubernetes defines a network model that helps provide simplicity and consistency across a range of networking environments and network implementations. The Kubernetes network model provides the foundation for understanding how containers, pods, and services within Kubernetes communicate with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes network implementations</strong>
Kubernetes built in network support, kubenet, can provide some basic network connectivity. However, it is more common to use third party network implementations which plug into Kubernetes using the CNI (Container Network Interface) API.</p>
<p>There are lots of different kinds of CNI plugins, but the two main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>network plugins, which are responsible for connecting pod to the network</li>
<li>IPAM (IP Address Management) plugins, which are responsible for allocating pod IP addresses.
Calico provides both network and IPAM plugins, but can also integrate and work seamlessly with some other CNI plugins, including AWS, Azure, and Google network CNI plugins, and the host local IPAM plugin. This flexibility allows you to choose the best networking options for your specific needs and deployment environment. You can read more about this in the Calico determine best networking option guide.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kubernetes-services">Kubernetes Services</h3>
<p>Kubernetes Services provide a way of abstracting access to a group of pods as a network service. The group of pods is usually defined using a label selector. Within the cluster the network service is usually represented as virtual IP address, and kube-proxy load balances connections to the virtual IP across the group of pods backing the service. The virtual IP is discoverable through Kubernetes DNS. The DNS name and virtual IP address remain constant for the life time of the service, even though the pods backing the service may be created or destroyed, and the number of pods backing the service may change over time.</p>
<p>Kubernetes Services can also define how a service accessed from outside of the cluster, for example using</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes DNS</strong>
Each Kubernetes cluster provides a DNS service. Every pod and every service is discoverable through the Kubernetes DNS service.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service: my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example</li>
<li>Pod: pod-ip-address.my-namespace.pod.cluster-domain.example</li>
<li>Pod created by a deployment exposed as a service: pod-ip-address.deployment-name.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DNS service is implemented as Kubernetes Service that maps to one or more DNS server pods (usually CoreDNS), that are scheduled just like any other pod. Pods in the cluster are configured to use the DNS service, with a DNS search list that includes the pod’s own namespace and the cluster’s default domain.</p>
<p>This means that if there is a service named foo in Kubernetes namespace &ldquo;bar&rdquo;, then pods in the same namespace can access the service as foo, and pods in other namespaces can access the service as foo.bar</p>
<p>Kubernetes supports a rich set of options for controlling DNS in different scenarios. You can read more about these in the Kubernetes guide DNS for Services and Pods.</p>
<p><strong>NAT outgoing</strong>
The Kubernetes network model specifies that pods must be able to communicate with each other directly using pod IP addresses. But it does not mandate that pod IP addresses are routable beyond the boundaries of the cluster. Many Kubernetes network implementations use overlay networks.</p>
<p>Typically for these deployments, when a pod initiates a connection to an IP address outside of the cluster, the node hosting the pod will SNAT (Source Network Address Translation) map the source address of the packet from the pod IP to the node IP. This enables the connection to be routed across the rest of the network to the destination (because the node IP is routable). Return packets on the connection are automatically mapped back by the node replacing the node IP with the pod IP before forwarding the packet to the pod.</p>
<p>When using Calico, depending on your environment, you can generally choose whether you prefer to run an overlay network, or prefer to have fully routable pod IPs. You can read more about this in the Calico determine best networking option guide. Calico also allows you to configure outgoing NAT for specific IP address ranges if more granularity is desired.</p>
