      <description>Kubernetes (K8s) is a very powerful tool, primarily concerned with orchestrating and automating the deployment and management of networked applications.
Understanding how Kubernetes works makes you an effective power user for building higher-level platforms. This workshop is aimed at technologists and team leads looking to lift up the hood and understand what are all the major parts of k8s in a fast-paces half-day session.
Key Takeaways  Understand the major goals and objectives of kubernetes Learn how kubernetes is architected Understand how to deploy and operate a service on kubernetes  Audience You should have a familiarity with containers and want to learn more about their orchestration on top of Kubernetes</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.
The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google&amp;rsquo;s experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.</description>

      <description>The person I first took a container workshop with was Jerome Pettazoni. He&amp;rsquo;s been a trusted trainer for QCon and me personally for at least four years now. He uses an application in his Kubernetes training course that we&amp;rsquo;re going to use to in the next sections.
Key Takeaways  Understand the sample app Understand some of the terminology k8s users to talk about applications  Start Kubernetes Dashboard Launch his slide deck where he discusses the app</description>

      <title>K8s Architecture and Components</title>

      <description>So we went through the high-level architecture of k8s. We saw what components run on the master and worker nodes. Let&amp;rsquo;s go just a bit deeper.
Key Takeaways  Understand about more complicated configurations for architecture components Explore the CNCF Cloud Native Landscape around Kubernetes  Running the control plane on special nodes It is common to reserve a dedicated node for the control plane (Except for single-node development clusters, like when using minikube).</description>

      <description>Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod&amp;rsquo;s contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific &amp;ldquo;logical host&amp;rdquo;: it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled.</description>
