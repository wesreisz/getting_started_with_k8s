Containers are the new unit of deployment. The reason is simple: containers are a very powerful tool that can streamline development and ops, save companies money by focusing on deploying a packaged unit, and reduce the friction in delivering software. However, the flip side is they’re a new paradigm to understand, many things are abstracted away, and they require apps to be built with a specific architecture to take full advantage of their features. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn about Docker basic concepts, how to run containers, create your own images, interact with the "Docker Hub", and more.
