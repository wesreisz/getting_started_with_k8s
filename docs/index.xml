      <description>Kubernetes (K8s) is a very powerful tool, primarily concerned with orchestrating and automating the deployment and management of networked applications.
Understanding how Kubernetes works makes you an effective power user for building higher-level platforms. This workshop is aimed at technologists and team leads looking to lift up the hood and understand what are all the major parts of k8s in a fast-paces half-day session.
Key Takeaways  Understand the major goals and objectives of kubernetes Learn how kubernetes is architected Understand how to deploy and operate a service on kubernetes  Audience You should have a familiarity with containers and want to learn more about their orchestration on top of Kubernetes</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.
The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google&amp;rsquo;s experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.</description>

      <description>Now that we have a basic understanding of what Kubernetes is and how it operates. We&amp;rsquo;re going to deploy a simple application and interact with it. We will write this app locally, buld it, push it to Dockerhub. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll create a docker-compose file and run it. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll use Kompose and discuss how it can help you go from a docker-compose.yaml file to a deployment yaml file for Kubernetes. We&amp;rsquo;ll deploy this file with the kubectl apply -f command.</description>

      <description>A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable a loose coupling between dependent Pods. A Service is defined using YAML (preferred) or JSON, like all Kubernetes objects. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a LabelSelector (see below for why you might want a Service without including selector in the spec).</description>

      <description>This architecture of Kubernetes provides a flexible, loosely-coupled mechanism for service discovery. Like most distributed computing platforms, a Kubernetes cluster consists of at least one master and multiple compute nodes. The master is responsible for exposing the application program interface (API), scheduling the deployments and managing the overall cluster. Each node runs a container runtime, such as Docker or rkt, along with an agent that communicates with the master. The node also runs additional components for logging, monitoring, service discovery and optional add-ons.</description>

      <description>Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod&amp;rsquo;s contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific &amp;ldquo;logical host&amp;rdquo;: it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled.</description>

      <description>The person I first took a container workshop with was Jerome Pettazoni. He&amp;rsquo;s been a trusted trainer for QCon and me personally for at least four years now. He uses an application in his Kubernetes training course that we&amp;rsquo;re going to use to in the next sections.
Key Takeaways  Understand the sample app Understand some of the terminology k8s users to talk about applications  spin up with docker compose</description>
